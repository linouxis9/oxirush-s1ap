//! Decoded PDUs as JSON trees that can be edited and encoded again.
//!
//! [`inspect_pdu`] returns `procedure_code`, `direction`, `criticality` and `message`: the
//! message in the ASN.1 JSON encoding (JER). An IE whose identifier has one type has its
//! typed `value` (`extensionValue` in an extension container) in place of its octets. A
//! contained transfer, and the value of an IE declared `OCTET STRING (CONTAINING ...)`, is
//! its `decoded` value beside its `_raw_transfer`. Repeated IEs stay ordered array entries.
//!
//! The values of some well-known types are shown as they are usually written:
//!
//! - a PLMN identity as its MCC and MNC, `"208-93"`;
//! - a transport layer address as an IP address, `"10.0.0.1"` or `"2001:db8::1"`, or as
//!   the two with a comma when it holds both;
//! - an IMSI as its digits;
//! - an identifier or a counter, such as a TAC, a GTP-TEID, a TMSI, a cell identity, the
//!   parts of a GUAMI or an SST, as a number.
//!
//! [`encode_pdu`] takes them in this form, a number also as a `"0x…"` string, and as JER
//! writes them. It takes the name of an ENUMERATED value as any other name: see
//! [Names](#names).
//!
//! The members that start with `_` say what was received:
//!
//! - `_raw_value`, `_raw_transfer` and `_raw_message`: the octets, in hexadecimal;
//! - `_original_id` and `_ie_name`: the identifier that the octets were decoded as, and the
//!   name that ASN.1 gives it. An entry whose `id` was changed is encoded as the type of
//!   its new identifier;
//! - `_decode_error`: why an IE's `value` is still its octets in hexadecimal, or why a
//!   transfer has no `decoded` member. The identifier is unknown or has several types, the
//!   octets do not decode, JER cannot represent the value, or the IE is nested deeper
//!   than 64 levels;
//! - `_edited`: [`set`], [`remove`] or [`insert`] changed something under the value, whose
//!   octets are no longer those beside it.
//!
//! [`encode_pdu`] encodes the tree. What was not edited keeps the octets received. To edit:
//!
//! - change a typed `value` or the `decoded` member of a transfer, which is encoded again.
//!   This is refused when the octets received do not decode and encode back to themselves,
//!   as with an extension addition that the typed value does not keep;
//! - to add an IE, write an entry with its `id`, its `criticality` and its `value`, and no
//!   `_raw_value`: the value is encoded as the type of the identifier, whatever JSON it is.
//!   The `id` is a number, or the name of the IE;
//! - to send given octets as an IE, write them in hexadecimal as its `octets`, or as
//!   `_raw_value`, and leave `value` out. For a transfer, replace the member with its
//!   octets;
//! - to add a transfer, or the value of an IE that contains a type, write it as an object
//!   with its `decoded` value alone, which is encoded as the type contained;
//! - an IE with a `_decode_error` has its octets as `value`: change them there.
//!
//! Beside a `value`, `_raw_value` is what the value is compared with, as `_raw_message` is
//! for the message, so changing one alone sends nothing else. A member that the ASN.1 type
//! does not have is refused, and so is one beside the `decoded` value of a transfer.
//! Hexadecimal is taken in either case.
//!
//! # Paths
//!
//! [`paths`] gives each value of a tree with the path that selects it, [`select`] the
//! values at a path, and [`set`], [`remove`] and [`insert`] edit a tree at a path:
//!
//! ```text
//! /s1ap/MME-UE-S1AP-ID/criticality = "reject"
//! /s1ap/MME-UE-S1AP-ID/value = 1
//! /s1ap/Cause/value/radioNetwork = "user-inactivity"
//! /procedure_code = 18
//! ```
//!
//! A path is a JSON pointer into the tree, where `/s1ap` stands for the IEs of the
//! message. The segment after it selects among them:
//!
//! - the name of an IE, as ASN.1 has it after `id-`: `/s1ap/eNB-UE-S1AP-ID`. An IE that is
//!   there twice is selected twice;
//! - a position, `/s1ap/0`, which is how [`paths`] names an IE that has no name or is
//!   there twice. A position is a number as decimal writes it: `0`, `12`;
//! - `@id=N`, the IEs with that identifier, whether it has a name or not, and `*`, each
//!   of them;
//! - `-`, the end of the list, where [`insert`] adds an IE.
//!
//! Under an IE are its `criticality`, its typed `value`, and its `octets`: what it was
//! received as, in hexadecimal. The IEs that a value holds, as the items of a list of
//! E-RABs, are selected the same way in their place:
//!
//! ```text
//! /s1ap/E-RABToBeSetupListCtxtSUReq/value/E-RABToBeSetupItemCtxtSUReq/value/e-RAB-ID = 5
//! ```
//!
//! Any other list selects by position and `*`.
//!
//! ## Names
//!
//! A name is its letters and its digits, whatever their case and whatever is between
//! them: `/s1ap/eNB-UE-S1AP-ID`, `/S1AP/enb_ue_s1ap_id` and `/s1ap/enbues1apid` are one
//! path. The root, the name of an IE, the members of a value, the name of a message
//! ([`message_named`], [`check_path`]) and the name of an ENUMERATED value are all taken
//! this way, and no two of them that could be taken for each other are the same. A
//! member that starts with `_` is named as it is.
//!
//! ## What is not there
//!
//! A path selects nothing where the message could have a value and does not:
//!
//! - an IE that the message does not have;
//! - an OPTIONAL member that is absent, and another alternative of a CHOICE:
//!   `/s1ap/Cause/value/nas` when the cause is one of the radio network;
//! - what follows in the path, which is still checked against the type.
//!
//! A name that the type of a value cannot have is an error, which lists the members
//! that the type has: a member that is written wrong is not taken for one that is not
//! there. So are a member of a value that has none, a path into a value that did not
//! decode, and the name of an IE in a list whose entries are no IEs. After `*`, a
//! segment is an error when none of the values that it is applied to can have it.
//!
//! [`check_path`] says the same of a path without a tree: whether it can select
//! anything in a message of a name, whose IEs are those of its object set
//! ([`message_ies`]).
//!
//! ## Edits
//!
//! [`paths`] lists the values of a tree without the members that start with `_`, except
//! `_decode_error`. The octets of an IE or of a transfer are selected as its `octets`,
//! which [`paths`] lists only for one that has no value beside them, and set there in
//! place of its value. Those of a value that an edit changed are an error to select:
//! [`encode_pdu`] gives the PDU its octets.
//!
//! [`set`] writes a member by the name that ASN.1 gives it, and refuses a name that the
//! type does not have. `null` takes an optional member out, as [`remove`] does; a member
//! that its type always has is not taken out, and an alternative of a CHOICE takes the
//! place of the one that is there. The value of an IE or of a transfer is not taken out
//! either, as its octets would be sent in its place.
//!

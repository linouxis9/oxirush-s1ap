//! Decoded PDUs as JSON trees that can be edited and encoded again.
//!
//! [`inspect_pdu`] returns `procedure_code`, `direction`, `criticality` and `message`: the
//! message in the ASN.1 JSON encoding (JER). An IE whose identifier has one type has its
//! typed `value` (`extensionValue` in an extension container) in place of its octets. A
//! contained transfer, and the value of an IE declared `OCTET STRING (CONTAINING ...)`, is
//! its `decoded` value beside its `_raw_transfer`. Repeated IEs stay ordered array entries.
//!
//! The values of some well-known types are shown as they are usually written:
//!
//! - a PLMN identity as its MCC and MNC, `"208-93"`;
//! - a transport layer address as an IP address, `"10.0.0.1"` or `"2001:db8::1"`, or as
//!   the two with a comma when it holds both;
//! - an IMSI as its digits;
//! - an identifier or a counter, such as a TAC, a GTP-TEID, a TMSI, a cell identity, the
//!   parts of a GUAMI or an SST, as a number.
//!
//! [`encode_pdu`] takes them in this form, a number also as a `"0x…"` string, and as JER
//! writes them. It takes the name of an ENUMERATED value whatever its case, with `-`, `_`
//! and space taken as the same.
//!
//! The members that start with `_` say what was received:
//!
//! - `_raw_value`, `_raw_transfer` and `_raw_message`: the octets, in hexadecimal;
//! - `_original_id` and `_ie_name`: the identifier that the octets were decoded as, and the
//!   name that ASN.1 gives it. An entry whose `id` was changed is encoded as the type of
//!   its new identifier;
//! - `_decode_error`: why an IE's `value` is still its octets in hexadecimal, or why a
//!   transfer has no `decoded` member. The identifier is unknown or has several types, the
//!   octets do not decode, JER cannot represent the value, or the IE is nested deeper
//!   than 64 levels;
//! - `_edited`: [`set`], [`remove`] or [`insert`] changed something under the value, whose
//!   octets are no longer those beside it.
//!
//! [`encode_pdu`] encodes the tree. What was not edited keeps the octets received. To edit:
//!
//! - change a typed `value` or the `decoded` member of a transfer, which is encoded again.
//!   This is refused when the octets received do not decode and encode back to themselves,
//!   as with an extension addition that the typed value does not keep;
//! - to add an IE, write an entry with its `id`, its `criticality` and its `value`, and no
//!   `_raw_value`: the value is encoded as the type of the identifier, whatever JSON it is;
//! - to send given octets as an IE, write them in hexadecimal as `_raw_value` and leave
//!   `value` out. For a transfer, replace the member with its octets;
//! - to add a transfer, or the value of an IE that contains a type, write it as an object
//!   with its `decoded` value alone, which is encoded as the type contained;
//! - an IE with a `_decode_error` has its octets as `value`: change them there.
//!
//! Beside a `value`, `_raw_value` is what the value is compared with, as `_raw_message` is
//! for the message, so changing one alone sends nothing else. A member that the ASN.1 type
//! does not have is refused, and so is one beside the `decoded` value of a transfer.
//! Hexadecimal is taken in either case.
//!
//! # Paths
//!
//! [`paths`] gives each value of a tree with the path that selects it, [`select`] the
//! values at a path, and [`set`], [`remove`] and [`insert`] edit a tree at a path:
//!
//! ```text
//! /s1ap/MME-UE-S1AP-ID/criticality = "reject"
//! /s1ap/MME-UE-S1AP-ID/value = 1
//! /s1ap/Cause/value/radioNetwork = "user-inactivity"
//! /procedure_code = 18
//! ```
//!
//! A path is a JSON pointer into the tree, where `/s1ap` stands for the IEs of the
//! message. The segment after it selects among them:
//!
//! - the name of an IE, as ASN.1 has it after `id-` and in any case:
//!   `/s1ap/eNB-UE-S1AP-ID`. An IE that is there twice is selected twice;
//! - a position, `/s1ap/0`, which is how [`paths`] names an IE that has no name or is
//!   there twice;
//! - `@id=N`, the IEs with that identifier, whether it has a name or not, and `*`, each
//!   of them;
//! - `-`, the end of the list, where [`insert`] adds an IE.
//!
//! Under an IE are its `criticality`, its typed `value`, and its `octets`: what it was
//! received as, in hexadecimal. The entries of a list of IEs in a value are selected the
//! same way, each with its own `value`:
//!
//! ```text
//! /s1ap/E-RABToBeSetupListBearerSUReq/value/0/value/e-RAB-ID = 5
//! ```
//!
//! Any other list selects by position, `*` and `@id=N`. An IE that the message does not
//! have selects nothing. A member that a value does not have is an error, whether its
//! type has none of that name or the value has it absent, so a member that is written
//! wrong is not taken for one that is not there. The name of an IE is taken in any case,
//! with `-`, `_` and space as the same, and the members of a value as ASN.1 spells them.
//!
//! [`paths`] lists the values of a tree without the members that start with `_`, except
//! `_decode_error`: the octets of an IE or of a transfer are selected as its `octets`,
//! and set there in place of its value. Those of a value that an edit changed are an
//! error to select: [`encode_pdu`] gives the PDU its octets. `null` takes an optional
//! member out; the value of an IE or of a transfer is not taken out, as its octets would
//! be sent in its place.

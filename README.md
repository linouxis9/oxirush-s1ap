A complete LTE S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) APER codec generated from the
3GPP TS 36.413 ASN.1 modules with
[`rasn-compiler`](https://crates.io/crates/rasn-compiler) and encoded with
[`rasn`](https://crates.io/crates/rasn).

The 5G companion crate,
[`oxirush-ngap`](https://crates.io/crates/oxirush-ngap), exposes the same API
shape, macros, generated-source release model, and example workflow for TS 38.413.

## Features

- Bindings generated from the six normative TS 36.413 ASN.1 modules sourced
  from the official 3GPP 36.413 v19.2.0 (`36413-j20.zip`) archive.
- Checked-in Rust bindings; normal builds and docs.rs do not run a generator,
  and the published crate excludes its raw ASN.1 inputs.
- Aligned PER encoding and decoding through `rasn`.
- Flat re-exports for generated S1AP types and compatibility aliases such as
  `S1AP_PDU`, `MME_UE_S1AP_ID`, and `ENB_UE_S1AP_ID`.
- `build_s1ap!`, `build_s1ap_ie!`, `extract_s1ap_ies!`, and
  `with_s1ap_ie_mut!` helpers for typed open types.
- ASN.1-derived IE IDs, procedure codes, procedure names, directions, and PDU
  kinds.
- Protocol helpers for PLMN, core-network, tracking-area, cell, and radio-node
  identities, plus bit strings and UE security capabilities.
- Optional `inspect` feature: a decoded PDU as a JSON tree that can be edited
  and encoded again. See [Inspection](#inspection).

## Quick start

```toml
[dependencies]
oxirush-s1ap = "0.3"
```

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.88.

```rust
use oxirush_s1ap::{build_s1ap, extract_s1ap_ies, s1ap::*};

let pdu = build_s1ap!(InitiatingMessage, UEContextReleaseRequest,
    IGNORE, UEContextReleaseRequest,
    REJECT MME_UE_S1AP_ID(42u32),
    REJECT eNB_UE_S1AP_ID(7u32),
    IGNORE Cause(Cause::radioNetwork(CauseRadioNetwork::user_inactivity)),
);

let bytes = pdu.encode().unwrap();
let decoded = S1AP_PDU::decode(&bytes).unwrap();
assert_eq!(decoded.procedure_code(), 18);
assert_eq!(decoded.procedure_name(), "UEContextReleaseRequest");
assert!(decoded.is_initiating());

let request: UEContextReleaseRequest = decoded.decode_value().unwrap();
extract_s1ap_ies!(request, UEContextReleaseRequest, opt enb_id: u32 = eNB_UE_S1AP_ID(id));
assert_eq!(enb_id, Some(7));
```

`build_s1ap!` takes a direction, procedure name, outer criticality, message
name, and zero or more IEs. Each IE is written as
`CRITICALITY IeName(value)`. Numeric IE IDs and procedure codes are generated
from the ASN.1 object sets rather than maintained by hand.

## Extracting IEs

```rust
use oxirush_s1ap::{extract_s1ap_ies, macros::MissingIeError, s1ap::*};

fn handle(request: &UEContextReleaseRequest) -> Result<(), MissingIeError> {
    extract_s1ap_ies!(request, UEContextReleaseRequest,
        req mme_id: u32 = MME_UE_S1AP_ID(id),
        req enb_id: u32 = eNB_UE_S1AP_ID(id),
        req cause: Cause = Cause(value) => value,
    );

    println!("MME={mme_id} eNB={enb_id} cause={cause:?}");
    Ok(())
}
```

A `req` field returns `MissingIeError` from the enclosing function when the IE
is absent or invalid. An `opt` field remains `Option<T>`. Without a custom
`=> expression`, extraction unwraps the generated newtype's `.0` field.

Of an IE that a message has twice, `extract_s1ap_ies!` and
`with_s1ap_ie_mut!` take the same one: the last that decodes.

## Common helpers

```rust
use oxirush_s1ap::helpers::*;

let network = plmn("208", "93");
let mme = gummei(network.clone(), 1, 1);
let tracking_area = tai(network.clone(), &[0x00, 0x01]);
let cell = eutran_cgi(network.clone(), 0x12345, 7);
let enb = global_enb_id(network, 0x12345);
let algorithm_mask = bytes_to_bitvec(&[0xe0]);
let capabilities = ue_security_capabilities(&[0xe0, 0xe0]);
```

## Inspection

The `inspect` feature turns a decoded PDU into a `serde_json` tree in the
ASN.1 JSON encoding (JER), and a tree into a PDU. Each value of the tree has
a path, in which `/s1ap` stands for the IEs of the message and an IE goes by
its name:

```rust
use oxirush_s1ap::{inspect, s1ap::S1AP_PDU};
use serde_json::json;

fn edit(pdu: &S1AP_PDU) -> Result<S1AP_PDU, String> {
    let mut tree = inspect::inspect_pdu(pdu)?;
    // /s1ap/MME-UE-S1AP-ID/value = 42
    // /s1ap/eNB-UE-S1AP-ID/value = 7
    // /s1ap/Cause/value/radioNetwork = "user-inactivity"
    for (path, value) in inspect::paths(&tree) {
        println!("{path} = {value}");
    }
    let cause = inspect::select(&tree, "/s1ap/Cause/value/radioNetwork")?;
    assert_eq!(cause, [&json!("user-inactivity")]);

    inspect::set(&mut tree, "/s1ap/eNB-UE-S1AP-ID/value", json!(9))?;
    inspect::remove(&mut tree, "/s1ap/Cause")?;
    let name = json!({"id": "eNBname", "criticality": "ignore", "value": "enb-1"});
    inspect::insert(&mut tree, "/s1ap/-", name)?;
    inspect::encode_pdu(&tree)
}
```

An IE is named as ASN.1 names it after `id-`, and also selected
by its position (`/s1ap/0`), by its identifier (`/s1ap/@id=8`) or with all
the others (`/s1ap/*`); `paths` gives the position of an IE that has no name
or is there twice. Under an IE are its `criticality`, its typed `value` and
its `octets`, what it was received as. The entries of a list of IEs in a
value are selected the same way, each with its own `value`:

```text
/s1ap/E-RABToBeSetupListBearerSUReq/value/0/value/e-RAB-ID = 5
```

`value` may be left out of a path. A segment that names no member of an IE,
which has `id`, `criticality`, `value` and `octets`, is taken in its value.
These two paths select the same value:

```text
/s1ap/E-RABToBeSetupListBearerSUReq/value/0/value/e-RAB-ID
/s1ap/E-RABToBeSetupListBearerSUReq/0/e-RAB-ID
```

What an IE has itself comes first: `/s1ap/Cause/value` is the value of the IE
and `/s1ap/Cause/*` each of its members, so the entries of a list that is the
value of an IE are `value/*`. A member of a value that is named as one of its
IE is reached after `value`: only a string of bits whose size varies has one,
its `value`, as in `/s1ap/TraceCollectionEntityIPAddress/value/value`. The
members that start with `_` are those of the IE too.

A path selects nothing where the message could have a value and does not: an
IE that the message does not have, an `OPTIONAL` member that is absent, and
another alternative of a `CHOICE`. A name that the type of a value cannot
have is an error, which lists the members that the type has, so a member that
is written wrong is not taken for one that is not there; what follows an
absent value in a path is checked the same way. Under an IE, the error lists
the members of its value, then those of the IE itself. `*` is each entry of a
list or each member of a value, without the members that start with `_`, and
a segment after it is an error when none of the values can have it.

A name is its letters and its digits, whatever their case and whatever is
between them: `/s1ap/eNB-UE-S1AP-ID`, `/S1AP/enb_ue_s1ap_id` and
`/s1ap/enbues1apid` are one path. The root, the name of an IE, the members of a
value, the name of a message and the name of an `ENUMERATED` value are all
taken this way, and a test holds that no two of them that could be taken for
each other are the same. A position is a number as decimal writes it.

`inspect::check_path(message, path)` says whether a path can select anything
in a message of a name, without a tree: under `/s1ap` the IE has to be one of
the object set of the message, and each segment under it a member that the
type has, through the lists, the alternatives of a `CHOICE` and the items of a
list of IEs. What is not known is not refused: the value of an IE selected by
`@id=N` whose identifier is unknown or has several types, a segment under such
an IE, which may name a member of its value, and the entries of a container
other than that of the message when they are selected by position.
`inspect::message_ies` gives the IEs that a message can have, from its ASN.1
object set: the identifier of each and whether its presence is mandatory, in
the order of the set. `inspect::message_ie_criticalities` gives the
criticality that the set assigns to each of them, and
`inspect::message_criticality` that of the procedure of the message: `reject`,
`ignore` or `notify`. `inspect::item_criticality` gives that of an IE that a
value holds alone, in a `ProtocolIE-SingleContainer`, by its identifier.
`inspect::enumerated_at(message, path)` gives the names that the value at a
path can have when its type is an `ENUMERATED`, such as those of
`/s1ap/Cause/value/nas`, as the specification spells them: a name that is not
one of them is never the value of a message.

A message is also written, and shown, as its name and its IEs by name:

```json
{"message": "UEContextReleaseRequest",
 "ies": [{"MME-UE-S1AP-ID": 1}, {"eNB-UE-S1AP-ID": 2},
         {"Cause": {"radioNetwork": "user-inactivity"}}]}
```

`inspect::message_from_tree` makes the PDU of that form: the name gives the
procedure code, the direction and the criticality of the PDU, and the message
the criticality of each IE. The IEs are sent in the order written; one that
the message does not have, by its name or by its identifier in digits, says
its `criticality`, and `{"octets": "…"}` in place of a value is the octets of
an IE as they are sent. `inspect::message_tree` shows a PDU in that form,
without what the specification assigns.

The form goes to any depth: the IEs that a value holds are each a name with a
value, as those of the message are.

```json
{"E-RABToBeSetupListBearerSUReq": [{"E-RABToBeSetupItemBearerSUReq":
  {"e-RAB-ID": 5, "transportLayerAddress": "10.0.0.1", "gTP-TEID": 1}}]}
```

An IE that a value holds alone or as an item of a list has the criticality
that `inspect::item_criticality` gives, unless it says another. One that has
none there, as `UE-associatedLogicalS1-ConnectionItem`, and an IE of an
extension container always say their `criticality`, and `message_tree` always
shows it: the tables have what the object set of a message of a procedure
assigns, and that of a single container, and no other. `message_from_tree`
also takes a value as `inspect_pdu` shows it, with an entry of `id`,
`criticality` and `value` for an IE, and the two forms in one message.

The content of a handover's transparent container is written and selected by
the name of its type. TS 36.413 gives it by reference where the ASN.1 has an
`OCTET STRING`, so a tree shows the octets, and the one that writes or reads
them says what they carry between eNBs:

```json
{"Source-ToTarget-TransparentContainer":
  {"SourceeNB-ToTargeteNB-TransparentContainer":
    {"rRC-Container": "0102",
     "targetCell-ID": {"pLMNidentity": "208-93", "cell-ID": 4660},
     "uE-HistoryInformation": [{"uTRAN-Cell": "00"}]}}}
```

`message_from_tree` encodes that value as the type, and so does `encode_pdu`
for one that `set` or `insert` wrote. A path goes through the same name, as
`/s1ap/Source-ToTarget-TransparentContainer/SourceeNB-ToTargeteNB-TransparentContainer/targetCell-ID`:
`check_path` reads it against the types, and `inspect::open(&mut tree, path)`
decodes the octets in a tree, after which `select`, `paths` and the edits go
into them.
`Target-ToSource-TransparentContainer` carries a
`TargeteNB-ToSourceeNB-TransparentContainer` the same way (TS 36.413 clauses
9.2.1.56 and 9.2.1.57). The `rRC-Container` stays octets: it is a message of
RRC.

`inspect::message_name(&pdu)` is the name that ASN.1 gives the message of a
PDU, such as `E-RABSetupRequest`, and `inspect::message_named` finds
the `direction` and the `procedure_code` that a tree has for a message from
its name.

What is not edited keeps the octets received, and repeated IEs keep their
order. An IE that is unknown or does not decode stays as its octets beside a
`_decode_error`; a PDU whose message does not decode is an error. An edit is
refused when the value around it does not encode back to the octets received,
as with an unknown extension addition, and when it has a member that the ASN.1
type does not have. An IE is added with `insert`, before the IE that the path
selects or at the end for `/s1ap/-`, as its `id`, by name or by number, its
`criticality` and its `value`, which is typed whatever JSON it is: an
`ENUMERATED` is added by its name. Given octets are sent as its `octets`,
without `value`. An IE is written this way wherever a tree has IEs: in the
items of a list of IEs, in a value that is set whole, and in a tree written by
hand. The module documentation lists the members of the tree and
the rules of an edit.

No edit at a path is taken and then left out. `set` writes a member by the
name that ASN.1 gives it and refuses a name that the type does not have.
`null` takes an optional member out; a member that its type always has is not
taken out, and an alternative of a `CHOICE` takes the place of the one that is
there. The value of an IE is not taken out, as the octets received would be
sent in its place: the IE is removed, or its `octets` are set. Once `set`,
`remove` or `insert` changed something under a value, the `octets` beside it
are no longer those of that value and selecting them is an error, until
`encode_pdu` gives the PDU its octets. `paths` lists the `octets` of an IE
only when it has no value beside them. What is nested deeper than 64 levels
stays as its octets beside a `_decode_error`, and the rest of the PDU is read;
a path into a value that did not decode is an error.

The values of well-known types are shown, and taken, as they are usually
written:

| Type | In the tree |
| --- | --- |
| `PLMNidentity` | `"208-93"`, the MCC and the MNC |
| `TransportLayerAddress` | `"10.0.0.1"`, `"2001:db8::1"`, or the two with a comma |
| `IMSI` | its digits |
| `TAC`, `FiveGSTAC`, `LAC`, `RAC`, `CI`, `GTP-TEID`, `M-TMSI`, `MME-Group-ID`, `MME-Code`, `Port-Number`, `CellIdentity`, `NRCellIdentity`, `UL-NAS-Count` | a number |

A number is also taken as a `"0x…"` string, each of these values as JER writes
it, and the name of an `ENUMERATED` value as any other name. An IMSI of an
even number of digits is taken as its digits only. A value that does not fit
its form, such as a transport layer address of another length, stays as JER
writes it. The other strings stay in hexadecimal: keys and algorithm masks,
the NAS-PDU and the other containers, and the node identifiers, whose length
says which kind they are.

Limits:

- An IE with an integer of 2^63 or more stays as its octets, and one with an
  extensible fixed-size `BIT STRING` of another size cannot be edited as a
  typed value: rasn's JER does not represent them.
- The feature compiles JER and APER code for every type of the protocol. A
  clean debug build of the crate with `-j 8` took 23 s with it and 7.5 s
  without, about three times as long, and about three and a half times the
  memory at its peak.

## Code generation

Cargo compiles the checked-in `src/s1ap.rs`, `src/registry.rs` and, with the
`inspect` feature, `src/inspect_registry.rs`.
Normal builds, docs.rs, and crates.io package verification do not run a
generator. The published crate excludes the generator and the ASN.1 inputs.

For maintainers, `build/` holds the generator, a package of its own whose
lockfile pins `rasn-compiler`. It reads the six `.asn` modules in `s1ap/`,
which Git ignores: the ASN.1 of clause 9.3 of TS 36.413 v19.2.0, one file per
module, taken out of the specification's document in the official
`36413-j20.zip` archive. The repository has no step that extracts them. From
the crate directory:

```sh
CARGO="$(command -v cargo)" cargo run --locked --manifest-path build/Cargo.toml
rustfmt --edition 2024 src/s1ap.rs src/registry.rs src/inspect_registry.rs
```

`rasn-compiler` finds rustfmt through `CARGO`. To the compiler's output the
generator adds the flat API, convenience methods, and `Display`
implementation. `src/registry.rs` is the list of the procedures and of the IEs:
one line for each, with its code or its identifier, its names and its types,
and for each message of a procedure the IEs of its object set.
The names that the macros take, `S1apPduKind` and the names and the types of the
`inspect` feature all expand from it, so each is written once.
`src/inspect_registry.rs` has what the `inspect` feature alone needs, among
it the list of the types: one line for each SEQUENCE and each CHOICE with its
members, which the paths of the inspection are read against. Commit the
three files after regenerating them. Do not edit them by hand.

The checked-in files were last regenerated on 2026-10-11, with the generator
of that revision and the rustfmt of Rust 1.88, from the ASN.1 named above:
the three files came out as they are committed, octet for octet. No CI job
regenerates them, as the ASN.1 is not in the repository.

oxirush-s1ap and oxirush-ngap share, octet for octet, the code that does
not depend on the protocol: `build/aper_fix.rs`, `build/containers.rs`,
`build/inspection.rs`, `build/registry.rs`, `src/inspect_paths.rs`,
`src/per.rs` and `src/sized.rs`. `tests/shared_files.rs` holds a digest of
each, so that an edit in one crate fails its tests until the file is the same
in the other and both record the new digest.

## rasn integration

`rasn-compiler`'s stable opaque-open-type mode is used because TS 36.413 relies
heavily on parameterized information object classes. Its experimental typed
mode emits unresolved object-set warnings and uncompilable bindings for these
six modules. `Any` stays inside the generated representation; the public macros
provide typed construction, extraction, and mutation.

TS 36.413 gives its protocol IE and extension containers an object set as a
parameter, which an opaque open type does not use. Each is one type:
`ProtocolIEContainer` and `ProtocolExtensionContainer`, of `ProtocolIEField`
and `ProtocolExtensionField`. They take the place of the types that
`rasn-compiler` resolves for each use of one.

The crate enables rasn's efficient `bytes` storage and leaves its unused `f32`
and `f64` features disabled. rasn 0.28's APER codec departs from ITU-T X.691
where S1AP reaches it, so the generator replaces the derived codec there with
narrowly scoped `Encode` and `Decode` implementations written against rasn's
public codec traits:

- constrained `SEQUENCE OF` containers, whose length determinant and
  components rasn misaligns;
- fixed-size `BIT STRING` values longer than 16 bits, which are
  octet-aligned;
- `OCTET STRING` and `BIT STRING` components and alternatives with a
  two-octet length determinant, which take the types of the `sized` module;
- extensible `SEQUENCE` values, whose decoders consume and skip unknown
  future additions.

All other values use rasn-derived codecs unchanged.

`S1AP_PDU::decode`, `decode_value`, and typed IE extraction reject incomplete
values and trailing whole octets. Outer PDUs retain opaque open-type bytes;
decoding and re-encoding a typed value with unknown future `SEQUENCE`
additions drops those additions. The codec does not enforce procedure state
or all mandatory and conditional IE presence rules; callers enforce those.

## Key types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `S1AP_PDU` / `S1APPDU` | Top-level initiating/successful/unsuccessful PDU choice |
| `InitiatingMessage` | Procedure code, criticality, and message open type |
| `ProtocolIEContainer` / `ProtocolIEField` | The IEs of a message: identifier, criticality, and value open type |
| `MMEUES1APID` | 32-bit MME UE S1AP identifier |
| `ENBUES1APID` | eNB UE S1AP identifier |
| `Cause` | Radio network, transport, NAS, protocol, or miscellaneous cause |
| `PLMNidentity` | Three-octet TBCD PLMN |
| `TAI` | LTE tracking-area identity with a two-octet TAC |
| `EUTRANCGI` | PLMN plus 28-bit E-UTRAN cell identity |
| `ERABID` | E-RAB identifier |
| `NASPDU` | Opaque EPS NAS payload |

## Examples

```bash
cargo run -p oxirush-s1ap --example build_pdu
cargo run -p oxirush-s1ap --example decode_manually
cargo run -p oxirush-s1ap --example extract_ies
cargo run -p oxirush-s1ap --example inspect --features inspect
```

- `build_pdu` covers Initial Context Setup request/response, UE Context Release,
  Handover Required/Acknowledge, S1 Setup Failure, and standalone IE creation.
- `decode_manually` constructs and inspects an S1 Setup Response through rasn's
  raw APER API.
- `extract_ies` extracts UE release, handover, and nested EPS-bearer/NAS data
  from decoded S1AP messages.
- `inspect` decodes an Initial UE Message, prints its values with their paths,
  edits one IE, adds one by its value and one by its octets, and encodes the
  PDU again.

The examples intentionally mirror the corresponding `oxirush-ngap`
examples, substituting the standards-defined S1AP messages and IEs.
